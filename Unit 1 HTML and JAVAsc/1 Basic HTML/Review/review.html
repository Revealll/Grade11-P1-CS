        Colours

    <p>
        <h3>
            The iphone 8 comes in 3 general colours
        </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Silver</li>
            <li>Space gray</li>
            <li>Gold</li>
        </ul>
        <p4>
            I personally like the space gray colour the most, as it doesn't stand out. This iphone is a perfect size, as it fits perfectly in your hand,it still has a home button and overall it is aesthetically pleasing. It has a nice feel and is comforting.

    <h1>Speed</h1>
    <p>
        The iphone 8 is not the slowest but also not the fastest as it is an older model at the moment. "It is a 4G device that is rated 4G LTE cat12 (603 Mbps)"
    </p>
    <h1>
        Apps
    </h1>
    <p>
        <h3>
            You can download whatever app you want in the appstore, but when you get your new iphone 8, it has many predownloaded apps. Some of the many include:
