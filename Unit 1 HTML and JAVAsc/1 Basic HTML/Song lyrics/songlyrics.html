    <h1>
        STAR WALKIN
    </h1>
    <h3>
        [Chrous]
    </h3>
    <p>
        Don't ever say it's over if I'm breathin'
    </p>
    <p>
        Racin' to the moonlight and I'm speedin'
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm headed to the stars, ready to go far
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm star walkin'
    </p>
    <p>
        Don't ever say it's over if I'm breathin'
    </p>
    <p>
        Racin' to the moonlight and I'm speedin'
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm headed to the stars, ready to go far
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm star walkin' (I'm star walkin')
    </p>
    <h3>
        [Verse 1]
    </h3>
    <p>
        On a mission to get high up, I know that I'ma die
    </p>
    <p>
        Reachin' for a life that I don't really need at all
    </p>
    <p>
        Never listened to replies, learned a lesson from the wise
    </p>
    <p>
        You should never take advice from a nigga that ain't try
    </p>
    <h3>
        [Pre-Chorus]
    </h3>
    <p>
        They said I wouldn't make it out alive
    </p>
    <p>
        They told me I would never see the rise
    </p>
    <p>
        That's why I gotta kill 'em every time
    </p>
    <p>
        Gotta watch 'em bleed, too
    </p>
    <h3>
        [Chorus]
    </h3>
    <p>
        Don't ever say it's over if I'm breathin'
    </p>
    <p>
        Racin' to the moonlight and I'm speedin'
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm headed to the stars, ready to go far
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm star walkin'
    </p>
    <p>
        Don't ever say it's over if I'm breathin'
    </p>
    <p>
        Racin' to the moonlight and I'm speedin'
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm headed to the stars, ready to go far
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm star walkin' (I'm star walkin')
    </p>
    <h3>
        [Verse 2]
    </h3>
    <p>
        Been that nigga since I came out my mama (Woo) 
    </p>
    <p>
        Thankin' God Daddy never wore a condom (Woo)
    </p>
    <p>
        Prove 'em wrong every time 'til it's normal
    </p>
    <p>
        Why worship legends when you know that you can join 'em?
    </p>
    <p>
        Th-These niggas don't like me, they don't like me
    </p>
    <p>
        Likely, they wanna fight me
    </p>
    <p>
        Come on, try it out, try me
    </p>
    <p>
        They put me down, but I never cried out, "Why me?"
    </p>
    <p>
        Word from the wise, don't put worth inside a nigga that ain't try
    </p>
    <h3>
